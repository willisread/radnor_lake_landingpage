# radnor_lake_landingpage
Radnor Lake landing page was created in February 2018 while reviewing HTML and basic CSS through Treehouse.

It is only a simple webpage/landing page. Images came from Unsplash and the color scheme was put together using color-hex.

After studying code for a year this is my first project that I created and finished completely.

All page content was written by William T. McCormick III. Webpage created and designed by William T. McCormick Built It 2018.
